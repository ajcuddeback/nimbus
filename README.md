# 🌩️ Nimbus — Real-Time Weather Station Platform

> A full-stack weather monitoring system that streams data from a physical Raspberry Pi sensor to a cloud-hosted application using MQTT, Spring WebFlux, MongoDB, and Angular SSR.

---

## 🛰️ Overview

Nimbus collects minute-by-minute atmospheric data from a custom-built weather station (running on a Raspberry Pi), ingests the data over MQTT into a reactive Java backend, stores it in MongoDB, and renders it in real-time via an Angular SSR frontend deployed on a virtual machine with NGINX.
